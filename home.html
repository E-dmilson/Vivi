                Happy Birthday Vivi, since the first time we met i knew you were special,
                every day every night we spent together, i honestly had never spent a whole night with someone
                but not because i couldn't, it was because nobody ever knew how to make me happy like you do,
                and today, well, today is my turn to make you feel more special, loved and wanted.❤
            </p>
            <p>
                ❤I can't tell you in words how happy i am to have you in my life, i can't tell you in my own 
                words how my heart reacts to your presence, whenever you're close, whenever you text me, our moments together...
                This is something ion wanna let go of, yeah i don't want to let go of you, because you're the reason of my smile
                i wasn't joking when i told you about being forever with you, about marry you, that was not a joke
                You're the first and only person i've shared my dreams with and i want to make them come true
                being by your side.❤
            </p>
            <p>
